Airborne security is an increasing concern in both indoor and outdoor environments, especially in healthcare facilities. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating smart safety solutions has 
become essential. This project presents a solar-powered, energy-efficient, and sustainable IoT infrastructure using Long Range (LoRa) technology, designed for advanced airborne security in public healthcare centers.
System Components:
* LoRa SX1278 modules (Transmitter & Receiver)
* ESP32 microcontrollers (x2)
* Gas sensors (6 tin-oxide-based, cross-selective)
* Particulate Matter (PM) sensor
* Temperature & Humidity sensor
* GPS module
LoRa transmits airborne signatures from the sensing zone to a Central Monitoring Station (CMS) and Stable communication found up to 745 meters in open space. Captured airborne signatures are pre-processed
using Standardized Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) for 3D scattering and dimensionality reduction. TabNet model was employed for classification.
Our system detects and classifies harmful pollutants, odors, VOCs, and gases in real-time. Enables low-power, long-range wireless communication in critical environments.
Supports sustainable and remote deployment through solar power and efficient hardware.
